==================

We want to help bloggers analyze their own blogging habits and behavior, so that they can improve their style.
With the help of the growing network of our users, this plugin will also be able to tell you what the most prolific bloggers do to be successful.

If you're worried that we're getting too much info about your habits - we're not.
We track what you do, but when we report the data to the server, we delete or obfuscate (for the tech savy: MD5)
all the information that could ever identify you, so nobody but you can see it.

Project is currently in the phase of just gathering data, but in the near future we'll make available reports that describe your style.
